### ⚙️ 1. What is a POE Media Converter?

A **POE Media Converter** enables both data and electrical power to be delivered over Ethernet while converting the signal to run over **fiber-optic cable**. It allows copper RJ45 connections to be extended over **single-mode** or **multi-mode fiber**, greatly increasing distance and reducing EMI interference.

#### Key Specs to Know:
- **802.3af POE Converter** = 15.4W output  
- **802.3at POE+ Converter** = 30W output  
- **60W POE Converter** (if available) = High-power PTZ camera use  
- **1G SFP POE Converter** = For IP surveillance or wireless APs

### 🔌 2. How to Extend POE Over Fiber

Extending POE over fiber involves bridging an RJ45 device to a fiber optic link. A **POE Media Converter**:
1. Accepts power + data over RJ45  
2. Converts the data to fiber (via SFP module)  
3. Sends the signal long-distance  
4. Optionally powers the remote device via POE (if converter is at the far end)

This solution is ideal for **remote IP cameras**, **access points**, or **smart kiosks** far from power outlets.

### 🏗️ 3. Fiber Types: Single-Mode vs Multi-Mode POE Converters  

| Fiber Type          | Use Case                            | Distance         | Cost      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Single-Mode Fiber Converter** | Long-haul, citywide links              | Up to 20–120 km | 💲💲        |
| **Multi-Mode Fiber Converter**  | Campus, building-to-building setups    | Up to 2 km      | 💲         |

Both work with **SFP fiber transceivers** and can be installed in **Tiny Industrial Converter** or **Standalone POE Converter** form factors.

### 🛠️ 4. Industrial Media Converter Installation Guide  

**Installation Steps**:
1. Mount unit (wall or DIN rail)  
2. Connect power input (24–48V DC industrial PSU)  
3. Insert correct SFP (match SM/MM fiber)  
4. Connect Ethernet (RJ45 IN/OUT)  
5. Confirm POE device (PD) is powered  
6. Optional: Secure with surge protection & cable glands

**Versitron POE Media Converters** offer plug-and-play functionality in harsh, industrial-grade enclosures.
